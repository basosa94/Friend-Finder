# Friend Finder

### Description

Friend Finder is a full-stack application that takes in results from the users' surveys and compares their answers with those from other users. The app will display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The survey contains 10 questions that are each answered from a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with the question.

Once the user answers all 10 questions and clicks the submit button, the user's answers will be tallied and compared against other people's answers to find the current user's most compatible friend. 

At the end of the survey, the result will be displayed, showing both the name and picture of the closest match.
